c++ Hash Table Implementation
Keys are strings, values can be ints, doubles, or strings

running 'Make' in main directory creates 'etest' executable in build directory

current size of table set at 101, was tested at size 11 to force collisions...

to set to another size, change size assignment in constructor in Hash.cpp
